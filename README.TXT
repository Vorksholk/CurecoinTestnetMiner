Simple miner to simulate some form of computational work rewarded with a certificate.

Program is nothing special, and won't make it into any final 2.0 releases. A more advanced version of it will likely be used for testnet for the forseeable future.

Instead of folding proteins, you're doing rounds of SHA256, so only run this for testing 2.0. Any coins mined with this program ARE NOT REAL CURECOINS.
